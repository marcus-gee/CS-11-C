# CS11-C

This is a repository containing the projects that I have completed in the C track of CS 11. The course description is as
follows:

"A self-paced lab that provides students with extra practice and supervision in transferring their programming skills to a 
particular programming language; the course can be used for any language of the student’s choosing, subject to approval by the 
instructor. A series of exercises guide the student through the pragmatic use of the chosen language, building his or her 
familiarity, experience, and style."
